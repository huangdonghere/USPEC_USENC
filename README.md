# USPEC_USENC

This repository provides the Matlab source code for the `Ultra-Scalable Spectral Clustering (U-SPEC)` and `Ultra-Scalable Ensemble Clustering (U-SENC)` algorithms, both of which have nearly linear time and space complexity and are capable of robustly and efficiently partitioning ten-million-level nonlinearly-separable datasets on a PC with 64GB memory.
